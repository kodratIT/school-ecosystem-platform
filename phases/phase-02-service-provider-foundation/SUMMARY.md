## ⚡ Quick Commands

### Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Type check
pnpm type-check

# Lint
pnpm lint

# Test demo SP
cd apps/test-service
pnpm dev
```

### Testing SSO Flow

```bash
# Terminal 1: Identity Provider
cd apps/identity-provider
pnpm dev  # http://localhost:3000

# Terminal 2: Test Service Provider
cd apps/test-service
pnpm dev  # http://localhost:3001

# Open browser:
# 1. Go to http://localhost:3001
# 2. Should redirect to http://localhost:3000/auth/login
# 3. Login
# 4. Should redirect back to http://localhost:3001
# 5. You're authenticated!
```

### Verify Installation

```bash
# Check all packages exist
ls packages/ | grep -E "(auth-client|middleware|api-client|layouts)"

# Check template exists
test -d packages/templates/service-provider && echo "✅ Template ready"

# Check demo app exists
test -d apps/test-service && echo "✅ Demo app ready"
```

---

## 🧪 Acceptance Criteria

### Functional

- [ ] Auth client can verify JWT tokens
- [ ] Middleware chain runs in correct order (auth → RBAC → tenant)
- [ ] SSO flow works end-to-end
- [ ] Demo SP can authenticate via IdP
- [ ] Multi-tenant filtering works
- [ ] Permission checking works
- [ ] Layouts render correctly

### Non-Functional

- [ ] All packages have TypeScript types
- [ ] All packages pass `pnpm type-check`
- [ ] All packages pass `pnpm lint`
- [ ] Code coverage >80% for critical paths
- [ ] Documentation clear and complete
- [ ] Template can bootstrap new SP in <30 min

## ❌ Common Issues

### Issue: "Cannot find module '@repo/auth-client'"

**Solution:**
```bash
# Rebuild workspace
pnpm install
pnpm build
```

### Issue: "JWT verification failed"

**Check:**
- JWT_SECRET matches between IdP and SP
- Token not expired
- Token format correct

### Issue: "School context not set"

**Solution:**
```bash
# Ensure middleware runs in order:
# 1. Auth (verifies JWT)
# 2. Tenant (sets school context)
# 3. Your handler
```

### Issue: "SSO redirect loop"

**Check:**
- Callback URL configured correctly
- Token being saved in cookie
- Cookie domain/path settings
- No conflicting middleware

## 📈 Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | How to Measure |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| **Bootstrap Time** | <30 min | Time to create new SP from template |
| **Code Reuse** | >80% | % of code shared across SPs |
| **Type Safety** | 100% | No `any` types in packages |
| **Test Coverage** | >80% | Critical paths covered |
| **SSO Success Rate** | >99% | Login flow completion rate |
| **Middleware Overhead** | <50ms | Request processing time |

## 🎯 Definition of Done

Phase 2 is complete when:

- [ ] All 9 stories completed
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] All packages built successfully
- [ ] Demo SP works end-to-end
- [ ] SSO flow tested and working
- [ ] Multi-tenancy verified
- [ ] Documentation complete

## 📚 Next Steps

After Phase 2:

1. **Phase 3: PPDB System**
   - Use SP template as foundation
   - Focus on business logic only
   - Should take 60% less time than without template

2. **Phase 4-16: Other Service Providers**
   - Same pattern for all services
   - Consistent architecture
   - Fast development
