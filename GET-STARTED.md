## 📚 What Has Been Created

Your project now has complete documentation and structure for Phase 0:

### 1. **Project Documentation**
- ✅ `ROADMAP.md` - Complete 16-phase development roadmap
- ✅ `GET-STARTED.md` - This file (quick start guide)

### 2. **Architecture Diagrams** (`/uml`)
- ✅ C4 Level 1: System Context Diagram
- ✅ C4 Level 2: Container Diagram  
- ✅ C4 Level 3: Identity Provider Components
- ✅ C4 Level 3: Service Provider Pattern
- ✅ Sequence: SSO Authentication Flow

## 🎯 Your Current Status

```
✅ Phase 0: DOCUMENTED (Ready to implement)
✅ Phase 1: DOCUMENTED (Ready to implement)
⏳ Phase 2: Pending
⏳ Phase 3-16: Pending
```

---

## 🚦 Quick Start (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Understand the Architecture

```bash
# Open architecture diagrams
open uml/README.md

# View system context (big picture)
# Open: uml/c4-level1-system-context.puml
# Using PlantUML viewer or online: http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/uml/
```

**Key Concepts to Understand:**
- **Federated Identity**: 1 central Identity Provider + Multiple Service Providers
- **Multi-tenant**: Each school is isolated with RLS (Row Level Security)
- **Better Auth**: Modern authentication with RBAC
- **Monorepo**: All apps + shared packages in one repository

---

### Step 2: Review Phase 0 Plan

```bash
# Open Phase 0 documentation
open phases/PHASE-0.md
```

**Phase 0 Overview:**
- Duration: 2 weeks
- Goal: Setup monorepo foundation
- Deliverables: 5 shared packages, configs, tooling

**What You'll Build:**
1. Turborepo + PNPM monorepo
2. TypeScript strict configuration
3. ESLint + Prettier
4. Git hooks with Husky
5. Shared packages:
   - `@repo/ui` - UI components
   - `@repo/utils` - Utility functions
   - `@repo/validators` - Zod schemas
   - `@repo/types` - TypeScript types
   - `@repo/config` - Shared configs

---

### Step 3: Start Implementation

```bash
# Open first story
open stories/STORY-001-initialize-monorepo.md

# Follow the story step-by-step
# Mark tasks as you complete them
```

**Story Workflow:**
1. Read entire story
2. Check prerequisites
3. Follow tasks in order
4. Verify each step
5. Mark as complete
